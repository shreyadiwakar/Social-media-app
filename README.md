##  Description

This is a full-stack Social Media Application where users can create profiles, share posts, like, comment, and follow other users. The application is designed with a modern UI and supports dynamic data fetching, authentication, and real-time-like interactions.

The frontend is built using React with Hooks, Context API, and React Query for efficient state management and API handling. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, while MySQL is used for database management. Authentication is implemented using JWT and cookies for secure user sessions.

##  Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-app.git
cd social-media-app
```
### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd api
npm install
npm start
```
##  Database Schema

The backend relies on five core tables. To set this up, ensure your MySQL workbench contains:

* **users:** `id, username, email, password, name, coverPic, profilePic, city, website`
* **posts:** `id, desc, img, userId, createdAt`
* **comments:** `id, desc, createdAt, userId, postId`
* **likes:** `id, userId, postId`
* **relationships:** `id, followerUserId, followedUserId`
* **stories:** `id, img, userId`
